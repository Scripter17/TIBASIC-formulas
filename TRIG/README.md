## TIBASIC-formulas : TRIG.8xp

Calculator for sine law, cosine law, complex valued trig. ratios, and finding an angle given 3 absolute points

### Variables

- A (A), B (B), C (C)=Side A, side B, and side C
- &theta;A (D), &theta;B (E), &theta;C (F)=angles opposite of A, B, and C
- PA (A&D)=Absolute point of point A on the Cartesian plane (Input AX (A) and AY (D))
- PB (B&E)=Absolute point of point B on the Cartesian plane (Input BX (B) and BY (E))
- PC (C&F)=Absolute point of point C on the Cartesian plane (Input CX (C) and CY (F))

Note: For things like `AREA (A B θC)`, which side is which doesn't matter, so long as θC is the angle between A and B in the triangle. You could input C, A, and θB and it'd still give the correct answer

### Formulas

- &theta;C given A, B, and C
- C given A, B, and &theta;C
- &theta;B given A, &theta;A, and B
- B given A, &theta;A, and &theta;B
- Area of a triangle given A B C, A B &theta;C, or A &theta;B &theta;C
- Perimeter of a triangle given A B C, A B &theta;C, or A &theta;B &theta;C
- sin, cos, tan, and their inverses for complex numbered inputs
- &theta;B given PA, PB, and PC
