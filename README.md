# TIBASIC-Formulas

A collection of math/physics formulas for the various classes I've taken over the years.  
All programs work on the TI-84+ v2.55, other versions probably work but are untested.

As of now, this is just an archive of my borderline-cheating shenanigans.
Everything in here is released under the ["Don't Be a Dick"](https://dbad-license.org) public license. Have fun.

## About all of the programs

- When you open the program, the menu options with formulas will be formatted like so: `[SOLVE FOR] (GIVEN [VARS])`. For example: `ΔT (V1 ΔT ΔD)`
- Note: The result of every calculation is put into `Ans`. If there's more than one answer, it'll be a list. Otherwise it'll be a number (Either real or complex depending on the inputs).
- There is a non-zero chance that some of these formulas are wrong. I take no responsibility for lost points caused by you using these programs on a test. Furthermore, I take no responsibility if your teacher catches you using these and counts it as cheating.

### Acknowledgements/thanks

Thank you to Spencer Putt, Chris Shappell, and James Montelongo for making [Wabbit EMU](http://wabbitemu.org/) which let me test the programs on my laptop instead of having to transfer it over to my calculator.  
A big thank you to Shaun McFall for creating [TokenIDE](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/433/43315.html), allowing me to create the programs on my laptop instead of using the TI-84 keypad.  
And finally, thank you to GitHub for allowing a proper GitHub markdown previewer in Atom.

This wouldn't be *nearly* as easy without any of you awesome people!
