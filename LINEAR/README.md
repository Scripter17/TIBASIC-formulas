## TIBASIC-formulas : LINEAR.8xp

Calculator for solving/converting standard, point-slope, and point-intersect form lines/linear systems

### Variables

- Since there's a lot of 'em and I'm lazy, just remember that the first var you input is set to A, the second to B, etc..

### Formulas

- Solve standard, point-slope, and point-intercept linear systems (find where two lines intersect)
- Convert standard, point-slope, and point-intercept line equations into either of the other two
